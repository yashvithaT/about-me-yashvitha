<h2 style="color: rgba(117, 62, 62, 0.73); font-size:large">Career Goals</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(59, 59, 103);font-size:medium">As an adult, I aspire to pursue a career in engineering. In the modern world, computer science is an essential skill and necessary whether you want to make a business, create a product or design a game. With my knowledge of computer science, I hope to be able to create and build products that can be powered through the magic of computer science. Even if I choose to pursue a career outside of engineering, computer science can definitely be a handy skill. For example, a career in business can go hand in hand with coding knowledge whether it is tech entrepreneurship or a business analyst. As for my education, I hope to get a bachelor's degree in computer science and a master's degree in business. To state simply, computer science is something I value because I know it will greatly assist me in the future, no matter what career I pursue. </p>
<h3  style="color:rgba(117, 62, 62, 0.73); font-size:large">Personal Qualities and Abilities</h3>
<p style="color: rgba(59, 59, 103, 0.942);font-size:medium">Some of my strengths when it comes to business and computer science are that I am assertive, cooperative and independent. This means that while I do work well with others, I can also create and develop a project on my own. My assertiveness allows me to take charge and initiative on projects, but I am also a team player that is open-minded to others suggestions. A few of my personality traits that I value are my wittiness, honesty and calmness. I am realistic and practical, which helps me keep a clear view on reality and think about projects in a way that can truly affect the world. I am not afraid to try something new or take risks when it comes to new experiences. At the same time, I am sharp-witted when it comes to making these choices and know I will always think things through. These attributes help make me a well-rounded individual.   </p>
<h4  style="color:rgba(117, 62, 62, 0.73); font-size:large">Strengths, Work Skills and Important Achievements</h4>
<p style="color: rgb(59, 59, 103);font-size:medium"> Throughout my academic career, one of my accomplishments has been being an honor student. I have enrolled in advanced placement courses and performed well in school. I have diligent work skills and am able to motivate myself while working on challenging projects. I strongly value intellect and always try to learn as much as I can. I have been part of various teams and sports through my educational journey, from the debate team to the basketball team to being a manager of a club.  I hope to continue to achieve as much as I can, especially educationally. 
    From experience I have learned that when I am interested in something, I will stick with it and continuously try to better myself in the area. For example, one passion of mine has always been martial arts. Whenever I lose a match, I try again, harder and more determined to win. Even when my martial arts school shut down, I did not let that stop me. Though I had to restart my karate journey, I was dedicated to my sport and I kept going. Whether it is a sport, academic course or a real-world problem, I trust myself in my ability to persevere and keep going. </p>
<h4  style="color:rgba(117, 62, 62, 0.73); font-size:large">Conclusion</h4>
<p style="color: rgb(59, 59, 103);font-size:medium">In retrospect, I truly enjoy computer science and all the possibilities that come with learning it. I have high hopes for my future and I hope to achieve my goals. I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to read through my page and thank you for visiting my site.</p>
